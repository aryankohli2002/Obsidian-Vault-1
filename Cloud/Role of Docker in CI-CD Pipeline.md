Imagine you're creating a website. And you want to host it to a server because you want to reach it to the people. So, after finishing the website, you upload that to the server. Then you see a few glitches on your website. Also, you are thinking of updating your website at a particular time. In both cases, website users will experience downtime, which will be a negative sight for your reputation.

Now, you must follow a CI/CD Docker approach for the code repository. Here you can push the changes on the repository, and you can test, run and deploy from it to your web and fix issues. This CI/CD pipeline doesn't affect the server downtime. 

This article will discuss CI/CD docker and other perspectives about this pipeline. So, let's get the discussion started. 

What does CI/CD Docker mean?

CI/CD refers to Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery. It is not a tool. It is a continuous methodology for SDLC( Software Development Life Cycle). If you run CI/CD with docker containers, you can call it CI/CD Docker. With the perfect application of the docker container or hub, you can improve the overall experience of CI/CD workflows without reaching its limit.

The main focus of the CI/CD pipeline is to deliver and integrate changes continuously. First, you must create a workflow and run it on every push to the master branch. It triggers a process that runs on Docker. Then you can tell the docker container what to do. 

Before CI/CD Pipeline

Before the automation process of CI/CD exists,  developers develop the entire code and then deploy it on the repository. They have to write the entire code, and only then can they push it to the repository. After that, the code is put to the test. If any bugs appear, the developers must track down and correct the problem from the entire coding. So, the problem arises like

It consumes a lot of time and resources for fixing.
It takes longer to go from design to testing.
Not convenient for developers.
Thus, this disadvantage will increase the hassle of deploying the codes at the production level.

CI/CD Docker Pipeline

The preparations and automation procedures are kept in a streamlined manner with a pipeline approach. A seamless automated test, build, and deployment experience requires a CI/CD pipeline. The steps in a CI/CD Docker pipeline are as follows.

First, the developers put the codes on the docker hub as version control. It then moves on to unit testing. Unit testing examines each unit. It implies that it tests the code up to the point when it is finished.
Then the following code is deployed initially. The code is subsequently executed via the autotest procedure. It checks to see if the code is working correctly.
The system is then deployed and evaluated in a simulated production environment to see how much downtime it has and its capabilities.
Then comes the quality assurance step. Here are measures and validates which indicate if the codes are ready to fulfill the parameters or not. If not, it detects the problem and indicates the source of the problem. Putting everything into a pipeline has a significant advantage in this regard.
For a pipeline, errors detection in tests can easily indicate the source of the problem. So, it becomes quite easy, and action can be taken quickly. 

After CI/CD Pipeline

With this pipeline, the developers create the code and instantly push it to the source code or repository. They don't have to create the whole code. Also, the repository synchronizes as soon as the codes are created.

The scripts are then run on the continuous integration (CI) server, where they are tested and delivered internally. It determines if the programs are capable of running on a real-time server.

Then, it forwards to the testing teams. There's a good possibility you'll be able to acquire the evaluation and get started on the assignments straight away.

So, the benefits are

It shows errors quickly.
It helps you save a lot of time and money.
It shows its capabilities when it is uploaded on the real-time server.
In deployment, you can deliver through a fresh, simple method. You can follow the CD( Continuous Deployment) process to deploy to the production level without any hassles and errors. 

Role Of Docker In CI/CD

Docker engine helps the developers to build the containers comfortably and deploy them. The Docker containers technology aids in detecting coding errors during the development cycle. Because it

Streamline the process 
Arrange the steps in a logical sequence in a pipeline.
Allows developers to build and test the codes simultaneously. 
Its exciting feature is working together with GitHub and Jenkins tools. Developers run and test the code in Github. Then use Jenkins to create an image. This image can also be added to the docker registry to cope with the various environment types. Its benefits are 

It allows developers to build tests in parallel. 
Improve version control for standardizing environments
Saves build and set up process
Conclusion

The conventional developers built the whole coding and ran the code. If they notice any inaccuracies there, they can track down the source independently. As a result, they will have to read the entire coding program, which will take a long time. They might be unable to concentrate on their other projects.

CI/CD is an automatic system and follows a pipeline process where individual processes are arranged simultaneously. There, you can create the code, and at the same time, you can test it. You will be able to focus on other tasks due to the automation process. Also, CI/CD Docker can detect problems and notify the source of coding for saving your valuable time.
